# Travel Between Visited Traders Changelog

## 0.6.16 - 2026-06-12 03:08 JST
- In multiplayer, the travel confirmation prompt now follows the server config, matching how access mode and travel cost already work. Clients connected to a server use the server's confirmation setting instead of their own local one. Single-player is unchanged.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.6.15 - 2026-06-11 02:39 JST
- Reduced NPC companions being duplicated when you travel in modpacks that use the SCore / XNPCCore companion system (such as The Wasteland). Following companions are now moved off the departing area just before travel, so the area you leave no longer keeps a copy that reappears when you return. Only your own following companions are moved, and companions told to stay or guard are left in place. The underlying companion behavior is the framework's, not this mod's, and companions duplicated before this update are not removed automatically.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.6.14 - 2026-06-09 01:14 JST
- Rebuilt against 7 Days to Die v2.6 (b14) so the mod binary matches the current game build.
- No functional changes and no save reset is required.

## 0.6.12 - 2026-06-07 02:00 JST
- Reduced NPC companions being duplicated when you travel in modpacks that use the SCore / XNPCCore companion system (such as The Wasteland), by changing how the teleport moves the player. In testing companions no longer multiplied per trip, though the underlying companion behavior is the framework's, not this mod's.
- Following NPC companions are now pulled to you when you arrive and placed around you on solid ground, so they are less likely to be left buried in the floor or stuck in walls. Only companions that belong to you and came along are moved; this does nothing on setups without companions.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.6.1 - 2026-06-01 15:08 JST
- Fixed travel cost not being charged to multiplayer clients when the travel transition was turned off (`enabled="false"` or `durationSeconds="0"`). The cost is now taken on the traveling client regardless of the transport screen. Hosts and single-player were already charged correctly, and the has-enough-items check was unaffected. This applies to any cost item.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.6.0 - 2026-05-30 19:27 JST
- Added an optional confirmation prompt before traveling, so an accidental click no longer moves you (and spends travel-cost items) immediately. After picking a destination you get a "Travel to X?" screen with Yes/No; No returns to the list.
- Configurable in `VisitedTraderTeleport.xml` with `<Confirmation mode="..." />`: `off` keeps instant travel, `always` always asks, and `whenCost` asks only when the trip costs items. The default is `whenCost`.
- Confirmation is a per-player client-side preference; in multiplayer each player uses their own setting.
- Destination entries now always show name, distance, direction, and coordinates, instead of dropping the coordinates on paid trips to fit the cost in. The exact cost is shown on the confirmation screen, and the per-distance rate stays in the destination screen header.
- Destination entries now also show the biome of each trader (forest, desert, snow, wasteland, burnt forest), since trader locations vary by world. The biome is captured when you visit a trader and stored with the visit, so it shows correctly for far traders too; traders already visited before this update fill in their biome the next time you talk to them.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.26 - 2026-05-28 04:45 JST
- Fixed the client-side travel-cost check so the configured cost is actually applied when starting a trip; previously the check used an empty default and let the trip proceed even when the player had no gas.
- Travel overlay now stays visible after the configured transition duration until the destination chunk is loaded on the client, so the trader you arrive at is rendered before the arrival message appears.
- Capped the additional overlay hold to 15 seconds so a missing or slow-loading area cannot lock the overlay forever.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.25 - 2026-05-28 04:06 JST
- Fixed travel-cost consumption on dedicated servers so the configured item is actually deducted from the player's inventory after a paid trip.
- Travel-cost item count is now checked and consumed on the client; the server no longer tries to mutate a remote player's inventory directly.
- Added a client-side travel-cost pre-check so insufficient-cost feedback appears immediately when the trip is chosen, instead of relying on the server's view of the inventory.
- Extended the destination preparation timeout from 8 to 12 seconds for slower dedicated-server chunk loads.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.24 - 2026-05-28 00:45 JST
- Fixed travel-cost consumption to use the multiplayer inventory update path so paid transport applies item removal more consistently.
- Added extra server-side logging around removed item counts and post-payment inventory totals for easier dedicated-server diagnosis.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.23 - 2026-05-27 20:03 JST
- Fixed dedicated-server travel cost checks using the same player inventory and bag item-count APIs used by other server-side mods.
- Fixed travel cost consumption to use the matching server-side item removal calls.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.22 - 2026-05-27 09:10 JST
- Prepare unloaded destinations asynchronously on dedicated servers before charging and starting transport, instead of immediately blocking the trip.
- Keep the no-charge timeout fallback if the server cannot prepare the destination safely.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.21 - 2026-05-27 09:00 JST
- Block dedicated-server transport before charging if the destination chunk is not already loaded, avoiding unsafe teleports into missing chunks.
- Restored asynchronous destination preparation for local games so unloaded destinations are prepared before travel cost is consumed.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.20 - 2026-05-27 07:18 JST
- Retry multiplayer package registration after the game rebuilds its base net package mapping, improving dedicated-server reliability.
- Added clearer server-side travel-cost logs showing required cost and inventory/bag counts when transport is allowed or blocked.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.19 - 2026-05-27 06:05 JST
- Show the mode, page, and travel-cost rate only on the destination selection screen, keeping the main trader dialog cleaner.
- Fixed multiplayer package registration so server-side transport requests, visited-trader snapshots, and travel-cost settings can sync on game builds with a smaller net package ID range.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.18 - 2026-05-27 03:49 JST
- Restored the full main trader dialog label for requesting transport.
- Moved mode, page, and travel-cost rate details into a separate status row so the main transport choice is less likely to be clipped.
- Fixed the transition overlay text layout so long transport messages do not overlap the wait hint.
- Stopped overriding trader dialog headings so the current trader name does not carry over after transport.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.17 - 2026-05-27 03:08 JST
- Shortened transport choice and travel cost labels so Japanese item names are less likely to be clipped in the trader dialog.
- Fixed trader dialog headings so localized trader names and the current access mode are shown consistently on both the main and destination screens.
- Expanded the travel overlay departure message to show the trader destination and coordinates.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.16 - 2026-05-27 02:41 JST
- Fixed long-distance transport failing when the destination chunk preparation never reached the game's ready state.
- Made the destination screen update the visible response-list heading directly so the current access mode and page status are shown reliably.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.15 - 2026-05-27 01:54 JST
- Renamed the trader dialog entry to better match the transport-service style of travel while keeping the label short enough for the dialog panel.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.14 - 2026-05-27 01:38 JST
- Shortened travel-cost labels in trader dialog choices so Japanese and other localized item names are less likely to be clipped by the game's dialog panel.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.13 - 2026-05-27 00:43 JST
- Removed the `disableCamera` transition config option; travel now uses the full-screen transition without exposing a separate camera toggle.
- Added the configured travel-cost rate to the main "Travel to a visited trader" dialog choice.
- Travel cost labels now prefer the game's localized item name, with `displayName` kept only as a fallback for custom items.
- Clamped invalid travel-cost and transition config values during load so negative, zero, or extreme numbers do not produce unsafe behavior.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.12 - 2026-05-27 00:29 JST
- Restored the destination screen access mode and page status by applying the response-list heading patch to the base dialog binding method used by the game.
- Stopped directly toggling the player camera during travel so `disableCamera` no longer flips camera-control behavior while the overlay is active.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.11 - 2026-05-27 00:08 JST
- Blocked player control and overlay input during the travel transition so the trip cannot be played through like a normal dialog moment.
- Added `soundRepeatSeconds` to keep the configured travel sound active during longer transitions.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.10 - 2026-05-26 20:08 JST
- Added a full-screen travel overlay while trader transport is preparing and in progress, then clears it before showing the arrival message.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.9 - 2026-05-26 19:58 JST
- Fixed a startup error when the optional destination-heading patch could not find the response-list binding method in the running game build.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.8 - 2026-05-26 05:04 JST
- Smoothed the travel transition so the default trip keeps the camera visible, shows clearer departure and arrival messages, and avoids stacking the generic teleport tooltip on top of the transport message.
- Changed the sample transition config to `disableCamera="false"`; existing configs keep their current setting.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.7 - 2026-05-26 04:49 JST
- Fixed the destination screen heading patch so mode and page status are applied to the response-list heading used by the trader dialog.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.6 - 2026-05-26 02:48 JST
- Moved destination mode and page status into the trader name heading on the destination screen so the selectable list stays limited to real choices.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.5 - 2026-05-26 02:14 JST
- Fixed destination screen status text so the current access mode and page count are shown above the selectable choices again.
- Changed the sample gas travel cost to `perMeter="0.1"` and added a Duke's casino token example using `casinoCoin`.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.4 - 2026-05-26 02:03 JST
- Moved destination screen status lines out of the selectable response list so only real actions show as selectable dialog choices.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.3 - 2026-05-26 01:38 JST
- Added `perMeter` travel cost configuration for finer distance-based cost tuning while keeping older `perKilometer` configs compatible.
- Destination choices now show the configured travel cost before selecting a trip.
- Added sound-key diagnostics for the optional travel transition sound and tried both bracketed and unbracketed sound keys when matching loaded audio data.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.2 - 2026-05-26 01:22 JST
- Fixed config loading for the travel cost and transition settings by using the active mod folder path provided by the game.

- Removed leftover local-only verification code from the main mod package.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.5.0 - 2026-05-25 05:18 JST

## 0.4.24 - 2026-05-23 19:45 JST
- Improved same-trader matching for old TXT/JSON records whose raw/internal trader IDs differ, such as `npcTraderRekt` and `traderrekt`.
- Reused existing matching trader records when recording a visit, preventing the same trader from being saved again under a slightly different key during the same session.

## 0.4.23 - 2026-05-23 08:24 JST
- Clarified upgrade and save-data compatibility documentation for existing users.

## 0.4.22 - 2026-05-23 07:03 JST
- Added friendly trader name mappings for Wasteland Mod traders Gene, Johnny, and Rad Cat.
- Recognized likely raw/internal Wasteland name tokens such as `tradergene`, `traderjohnny`, and `spheretest`.

## 0.4.19 - 2026-05-22 20:31 JST
- Fixed duplicate destination entries when the same trader was recorded from slightly different interaction positions.
- Separated trader identity from teleport destination position: the trader's position is used for stable matching, while the player's conversation position remains the saved travel destination.
- Existing nearby duplicate trader records are merged automatically on load when they refer to the same trader.
- No save reset is required.

## 0.4.18 - 2026-05-22 19:49 JST
- Normalized legacy TXT destinations in memory so old shared data is less likely to duplicate JSON destinations.
- De-duplicated destination lists when legacy TXT and JSON records refer to the same nearby trader.

## 0.4.13 - 2026-05-22 12:51 JST
- Added the active access mode to the trader travel destination screen.

- No save reset is required.

## 0.4.10 - 2026-05-17 16:17 JST
- Added a preventative stability improvement for reported freezes when teleporting to distant or unloaded trader destinations. The reported freeze was not reproducible in local testing.
- Destination areas are now prepared briefly before teleporting when needed.
- Avoided synchronous terrain-height lookup on unloaded chunks to reduce the chance of short freezes during travel.
- Fixed current trader filtering by keeping the active trader for the dialog session and matching by trader area as well as key.

- Added an opt-in local testing mode that records all known traders when talking to any trader.
- Test-mode destinations are saved two blocks in front of each trader's facing direction to make unloaded-destination testing easier.
